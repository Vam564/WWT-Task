### Welcome to Reacterviewing, the repo with surprisingly little in it

This repo consists of couple of tasks 
1. Album Task
2. Contact Search Engine 

Album Task: 
  It will show album titles and images in a list view. The album title and image are retrieving from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). When we click on "Remove all E's" button it will remove all E's from the album titles.
